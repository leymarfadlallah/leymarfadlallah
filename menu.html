<p>Place fava beans, chickpeas, and onions in a food processor and process until beans and chickpeas are very finely ground. Add remaining ingredients, except oil; process to a dough-like paste. Form into patties--if patties tend to crumble, process further or add a little flour.

Heat oil in a saucepan and fry patties over medium heat, turning until they are golden brown on both sides.

Serve patties warm as main dish with fresh vegetables and Sesame Tahini Sauce on the side or in sandwiches of half-rounds of pita bread stuffed with salad vegetables and topped with Tahini Mix.</P>

<P>

Chicken Shawarma is a popular gourmet sandwich that you can get at Middle Eastern restaurants. Marinated chicken chunks are mounted on a large rotating skewer and then roasted slowly to perfection against a gas burning grill. Due to the unavailability of such industrial roasters at homes, Chicken Shawarma has typically remained a restaurant dish. </P>
